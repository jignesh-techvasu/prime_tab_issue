# PrimeNG

This is just clone of actual prime repo : https://github.com/primefaces/primeng (version : ea64d11)

The purpose is to demonstrate the issue with prime tabs. I have make it inside the clone so that you guys can see issue without any efforts. To see it in action...

- clone the repo
- npm install
- npm start
- goto : http://localhost:8080/#/tabview

Now just try clicking on 3 buttons given below the Default tab. You can see they are switching the tabs perfectly.

- Now try clicking on any of the tab. You will see Growl message about current tab. 
- Then try switching the tab using buttons given below. You will notice they have stopped working and behaving strange.

Thank you.
